# Iris Data Exploration

This repository contains my work for Task 1 of the AI/ML Engineering Internship at DevelopersHub Corporation.

## Objective
To load, explore, and visualize the famous Iris dataset to understand its structure and distributions.

## Dataset
- Source: Built-in dataset from seaborn
- Contains 150 samples with 4 numerical features and 1 categorical label (species)

## What I Did
- Loaded the dataset using pandas and seaborn
- Printed basic information and statistics
- Created visualizations:
  - Scatter plot of sepal length vs sepal width
  - Histograms for each feature
  - Box plots to detect outliers

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook file and run all cells in order.

## Results
The dataset shows clear separations between species based on petal measurements. Some features have slight outliers visible in box plots.
